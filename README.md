2WS20-Modeling

This repository holds the notebooks and other code used for the RNA-sequencing project of group 7 during the course 2WS20 - Probability Theory.

There are two notebooks: one containing tools for analyzing the human RNA data and the other containing the model.

The former is used to determine distributions of nucleotides, codons, and amino acids for a file of RNA sequences.

The latter uses such distribution of codons to create input for the model of an RNA sequencing machine. This notebook additionally contains tools for running experiments in bulk, and visualize the results.
